<div><h3>Radhika Vaidyanathan:</h3>&nbsp;
<p>I grew up in Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu. My father has been a source of inspiration since my childhood. During schooldays, he engaged and involved me in many hands-on projects in and around the home. His inspiration made me pursue engineering degree. I earned my Computer engineering from Bharadhidasan University, Tiruchirapalli in 2002. In 2002, I moved to United States immediately after marriage. I started my career in software programming, but later discovered my passion for teaching. I joined a learning center that coached many children to John Hopkins University talent search award ceremony. Eventually, I was given a wonderful opportunity to run the learning center. Over a period of time, I was able to gain the trust of the parents and children. Parents constantly reached out to me for advice and guidance for their child’s education. I always consider the child’s strengths, interests and weaknesses to suggest courses and action plan accordingly. My passion for community service continued when I co-created a Tamil club in my locality. The club offered free Tamil lessons to children at the public library and also engaged the community with many activities and events throughout the year.  In 2013, I relocated to Bangalore, India to be close to my extended family. My husband works for a Media company. My husband and I are blessed with 2 children. Varun is 9 yrs old and loves playing basketball. Vishaka is 6 yrs old and loves painting. I love traveling, enjoy adventure sports, energize myself playing computer games, find satisfaction in community service and have insatiable hunger for learning new skills.
